A implementation of the segment-level loss for retinal vessel segmentation. If you find the metrics useful, please cite the upcoming paper

Z. Yan, X. Yang, and K. -T. Cheng, "Joint segment-level and pixel-wise losses for deep learning based retinal vessel segmentation," IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2018. 

This project contains:

1. Experimental results on different datasets including probability maps, mask maps, hard segmentation maps and maual annotations.
2. Source code to implement the segment-level loss

Should you have any qustions in either understanding or implementing the loss, please send emails to z.yan@connect.ust.hk.
